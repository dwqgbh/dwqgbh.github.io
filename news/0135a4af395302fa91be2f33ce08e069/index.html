E. and enjoying sugary drinks and snacks. It wasn’t until she reached her 40s, weighing around 300 pounds, that she decided to change her lifestyle. Simple diet changes, like cutting out soda and limiting desserts, helped her lose 50 pounds. But she hit a plateau (</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">停滞期</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">) and knew she needed to start moving. </span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">Initially, Laska decided to just walk. Gradually, she added running to her routine, starting with just one side of a tennis court and eventually running her first mile in 2014. </span></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">Laska kept her new habit a secret at first. One day, at the park with her kids, she decided to run to catch up with them on their bikes. “The look on my daughter’s face when she saw me running was like she saw Santa Claus,” Laska recalls. That’s when she started taking her one-mile jogs up to a 5 km,10 km, half-marathon and eventually marathon distance. In 2015, she ran her first marathon and won the first place in her age group. </span></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">“What motivated me was that it wasn’t as hard as I thought,” says Laska, who has lost a total of 140 pounds and kept it off for four years. “People make huge decisions, but I just made a small choice to take a walk.” She emphasizes that these small decisions can snowball into significant changes. </span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">Taking life one step at a time has not only improved Laska’s well-being but promoted relationships with her husband and kids and even brought on a promotion at work. When asked about the key to losing weight, Laska says, “Exercise. For me, it is not about running a marathon, but about those daily decisions to just go outside.”</span></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">24</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">Why did Laska want to change her lifestyle?</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">A</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">To remain young.</span></font></span><span/><span><span leaf="">B</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">To reduce weight.</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">C</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">To inspire children.</span></font></span><span/><span><span leaf="">D</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">To appreciate music.</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">25</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">How did Laska begin her exercise journey?</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">A</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">By just going on foot.</span></font></span><span/><span><span leaf="">B</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">By forming a new habit.</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">C</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">By running along a court.</span></font></span><span/><span><span leaf="">D</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">By simply changing diets.</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">26</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">What drove Laska to run longer?</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">A</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">Her kid’s amazement at her running.</span></font></span><span/><span><span leaf="">B</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">Reaching a plateau in losing weight.</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">C</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">Significant changes brought by running.</span></font></span><span/><span><span leaf="">D</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">Getting a prize in running marathons.</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">27</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">What does the author want to tell us?</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">A</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">Better late than never.</span></font></span><span/><span><span leaf="">B</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">More haste, less speed.</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">C</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">Actions speak louder than words.</span></font></span><span/><span><span leaf="">D</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">Small steps, big benefits.</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">On a warm and damp June morning, Emily Bick winds through a field of knee-high corn. It feels like that quiet, expectation-filled moment before a concert: Tech people are setting up microphones, connecting wires. The star of this particular show is the microphone itself. Research assistants are attaching it to the corn stalks (</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">茎</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">), an innovation that Bick named the Insect Eavesdropper (</span></font><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">窃听器</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">). </span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">Bick, an insect scientist, researches ways to better detect the agricultural pests that drive serious economic losses worldwide. She says improving these methods could result in using pesticides more strategically — less often, at just the right time. Corn rootworm, also known as the “billion-dollar bug,” feeds on corn roots, limiting the plant’s nutrient supply and making stalks fall over. As a result, 20% of the crop is lost to the insect every year. Worse still, climate change is bringing new challenges, such as the multiplication of insects in warmer temperatures. In our global society, experts say rapid pest detection will be critical to food production. </span></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">Bick’s solution to the problem of pest detection is sound: Eavesdropping on the unique vibrations (</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">震动</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">) that an insect makes when chewing on a plant to identify the insect itself. The Insect Eavesdropper uses a contact microphone, an affordable device that musicians often use on instruments. A little disc sits on a solid object — like corn — and captures the vibrations moving through it, registering each one with an electrical signal. “When corn rootworm feeds on the roots, the vibration translates from the root system to the stalk,” Bick says. “That’s where we’re picking </span></font></span><u><span><span leaf="">it</span></span></u><span><span leaf=""> up. We’re using the plant as the musical instrument, as essentially the outside of a guitar.”</span></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">Bick and her colleagues’ findings aren’t published yet, but as of now, their detection method is anywhere from 80% to 96% accurate. The team are still working on the data-processing pipeline, but hope they can get the Insect Eavesdropper on the shelf in a couple of years. Their goal is to advance pest detection — and maybe inspire people to listen to everything a little closer.</span></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">28</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">What is Bick’s purpose in working in the corn field?</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">A</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">To prepare for a concert.</span></font></span><span/><span><span leaf="">B</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">To arrange for a study.</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">C</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">To make the show special.</span></font></span><span/><span><span leaf="">D</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">To innovate planting ways.</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">29</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">Why is corn rootworm named “billion-dollar bug”?</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">A</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">Its nutrient is rich.</span></font></span><span/><span><span leaf="">B</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">It causes great loss.</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">C</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">Its number is limited.</span></font></span><span/><span><span leaf="">D</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">It brings huge profits.</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">30</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">What does the underlined word “it” in paragraph 3 refer to?</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">A</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">The corn.</span></font></span><span/><span><span leaf="">B</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">The signal.</span></font></span><span/><span><span leaf="">C</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">The system.</span></font></span><span/><span><span leaf="">D</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">The vibration.</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">31</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">Which of the following words can best describe the Insect Eavesdropper?</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">A</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">Perfect.</span></font></span><span/><span><span leaf="">B</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">Inspiring.</span></font></span><span/><span><span leaf="">C</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">Promising.</span></font></span><span/><span><span leaf="">D</span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">．</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">Purchasable.</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">Socrates declared that the unexamined life wasn’t worth living for a human being, implying that we should attempt to know ourselves, to think through our actions, choices, prejudices, and attitudes. But when it comes to thinking about our own happiness and what makes our lives go well, it really does seem that this reflective attitude can ruin our chances of finding what we seek. </span></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">Perhaps it’s not surprising that we are better designed for engaging in other activities than reflecting on how best to achieve our own happiness and well-being. Doing things that enhance our growth in physical, social and intellectual areas tends to bring the reward of feeling good, and so stimulates us further to pursue those activities. Sitting around reflecting on what will make us happy is a lot less efficient than chasing the things that make us happy, and if we think too much, there is an opportunity cost — time that we could have spent in a worthwhile activity has gone while we were thinking deeply about the best way to develop. </span></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">The philosopher David has written about the role of reflective thinking in sports. One of his observations is that while sportspeople need to think about the basic actions they are performing, it can be counterproductive to start thinking about the elements making up those actions. A footballer needs to think about kicking the ball low and hard to the left of the goalkeeper, but not to overthink the mechanics of the precise small movements of legs and feet that produce that outcome. If he or she does start this sort of thought process, it very often leads to a poorer shot.

But Andy knew his short legs made it hard for him to skate fast. </span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">One day, Andy was greeted by a pleasant “Hello” as he was putting on his roller-skates. He looked up and saw his new neighbor, Francis. “Hello! ” he replied cheerfully, noticing his neighbor’s long legs. “Wanna skate with me? Look at your long legs! Just the right kind to make you a good skater.” “I’d love to. You know, I’m really good at roller skating and I used to help my team win.” Francis said, his tone now heavy with sadness. “But I lost my roller skates and my mom just cannot afford to buy me another pair.”</span></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">Andy thought it was a shame for Francis. As a new comer, there were undoubtedly many moments when he must have felt lonely. Andy thought to himself, wondering what he could do for Francis. But he had to say goodbye in a hurry since the team were meeting in the open space on the corner to talk over some plans. </span></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">When talking to the team captain, Andy suggested adding another boy to their team, Francis. But the captain said “No” as the team knew nothing about him. Besides, the Shadysiders wouldn’t let them take on an extra player. </span></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">In the following days, Andy practiced very hard with his team. Then came the day before the race when he saw Francis on the sidewalk, watching them skate past, his eyes filled with a sense of loss. Somehow it upset Andy, and his desire to help his new neighbor resurfaced. Then he thought of a way that could not only help his team win, but help Francis fit in. </span></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">注意：</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">(1) </span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">续写词数应为</span></font><font face="Times New Roman"><span leaf="">150</span></font><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">个左右；</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">(2) </span><font face="宋体"><span leaf="">请按如下格式在答题纸的相应位置作答。</span></font></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">He rushed to Francis, excited to tell him his plan. </span></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">The next day, the race began as scheduled. </span></span><span><p/></span></p><p><span><span leaf="">_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></span></p><p><span><span leaf=""><a class="weapp_text_link js_weapp_entry" data-miniprogram-type="text" data-miniprogram-appid="wx9f6b8dc04406a1bf" data-miniprogram-path="/pages/koc/kl?fid=554675491337015296&sid=13853992" data-miniprogram-nickname="微件夹" data-miniprogram-servicetype="">2025届广东省大湾区普通高中毕业班联合模拟考试（一）英语试题 (1).docx</a></span></span><span><p/></span></p><p><mp-style-type data-value="3"/></p>
